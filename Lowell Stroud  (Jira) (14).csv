Identify multiple personas and workflows we currently have in place, then identify the gaps or improvements we have. A focus on security, device integrity and customer experience. Possibly come up with automation or improved processes that we can introduce to the DWE Team (Windows, Mac and Mobile).

Purpose will be to build out a workflow diagram that we can bring to DWE and other involved to present our findings and possible solutions.

*Reporting Discussion –*

* Identify the manual process as of today and what we’d like to do to automate
** Snow form submitted
** Engagement submitted to CSOC
** Unknown any other engagements sent or who is notified (Talen, Asset, etc.)
** Tier 2 works the Task ticket – custom support group (Wipe or remove from network, decrypt drive, etc.)
** Recent ask to replace CSOC engagement
* Submitted by the customer to report lost/stolen – no approval necessary (query’s their devices signed in by user)
** OK to remotely wipe the device (Windows, Mac and Mobile)
* Tier 1 – submitted on behalf of – would like to have approval or maybe Sr Agent to agree before automated wipe sent
** Sr Agent confirms device and allows the remote wipe (Windows, Mac and Mobile)
* CSOC engagement when a remote wipe command sent but device is checking in consistently (if beyond 60 days)
** This should require a CSOC investigation ticket – to take further action
* API Call from ServiceNow to Intune Remote wipe (Windows/Mobile)
** Currently only able to do this with currently logged in user (no option to submit On Behalf)
** Verify if the manager can submit the Lost/Stolen on behalf of the employee
** Extend this to allow for Tier 1 to submit on behalf of user for lost stolen (with Sr Agent Assist)

*CSOC & HR/Talent Requirements -* 

* Tamatha - question – using HR form, a case is created and submits to SecOps team
** Appears that some cases are picked up and worked by SecOps
* SecOps unknown what action they will take – on lost/stolen form
** Depending on what was stolen and what actions they take
** Is this just a database or notification portal
** Determine if this is just informational
* HR/Talen only creates a ticket to SecOps – ALL Company Property Type
** Sarah Dotson and Tamatha, Baily – Lindsay Lynch to make changes to existing form
** At least to stop people from using this for mobile, windows, mac or other hardware assets
** Determine if SecOps has any requirements when it comes to these or if they just need to be informed that the asset has been reported
* Follow up with SecOps team, Alex, Jim and Michael to discuss further","14/Nov/25 9:10 AM;557058:85ee93a6-e3f7-45c0-946e-feea53716d8e;[^RE_ Request for Guidance on HR Contacts and Process Revitalization.msg]

","14/Nov/25 9:32 AM;557058:85ee93a6-e3f7-45c0-946e-feea53716d8e;Great and yes, the guardrails question continues to be a focus of conversation as we begin to design this out. We just had a good discussion with HR/Talent who confirmed that they don’t take any actions with the items submitted through their version of the lost/stolen device form – they simply engage SecOps to take whatever action they need to on that asset.

We have a follow up call with SecOps next week to try and determine exactly what actions they take, what they need, and any specific requirements if we move this process over to ITSM form for lost/stolen. It’s starting to look like HR/Talent has no need for their specific form, that it’s all around SecOps so the hope would be we can keep this process simple as there appears to be some outdated workflows with that groups existing form and process.

Are there any specific questions from your team we should ask next week or confirm? This is a high-level discussion on finding out what they would need if we make this move to ITSM form – not necessarily a feasibility discussion.

* *Lost* - SecOps not too concerned and not need to be notified (maybe no police report needed)
* *Stolen* - SecOps would like to be notified - for ALL Thefts and on any products
** OK to have device Wiped prior to notifing SecOps? - OK to wipe
** Require or ask for Police Report? Would like to have a Police if applicable
** Can the existing form be hidden from PROD so not searchable from HelpHub - or is there a need for it live now?
** EOL SO300 form by end of Feb 2026
** Confirmed that Lost/Stolen myInventory form does notifiy SecOps for ALL assets that come through

Need to determine and confirm what type of action or information SecOps needs when a user reports one of the following items as Lost/Stolen:

* *BYOD Phone / Tablet (Personal)* - Stolen Only?
* *Corporate Mobile Device* - Stolen Only
* *Documents* - Lost/Stolen
* *Other Equipment/Materials/Objects Not Mentioned Above* - Lost/Stolen
* *RSA Token - Yubikey?* - Lost/Stolen Both
* *Tablet* (Co or Personal)
* *Thumb/USB Drive* - Lost/Stolen Both
* *Wireless LAN/MiFi* - Stolen Only
* Add *Keys or Hard Keys* - Lost/Stolen

Suggestion to move these into myInventory portal to capture ALL assets into a singe location and create custom workflows for anything SecOps needs to be notified and/or where this database is stored so both Tech Help and SecOps can access the data.

* If we need to maintain 2 separate Lost/Stolen, then I suggest all physical Assets live under the myInventory Lost/Stolen and HR/Talent record maintains ALL Other items
* Also discuss what Lost/Stolen fields are required for SecOps or what they need

* Lost/Stolen US Domestic submission
* Creates a Task if Bitlocker encrypted – Auto triggered?
** Active encryption – checks Nexthink first (last time it was seen and last public IP address)
** Adding that info to the Task
** Then Intune – (for Mac use Jamf) check serial number and device is still showing as reported as – check device compliance
** If not in either location, checks ServiceNow CMDB – April 2024 (transitioned to fulfiller)
*** If unable to verify encryption – sending to Legal Data Security, CSOC L2 and Asset Management Hardware
*** Close the Task – Resolution (closed complete)
**** If device is still in use, then mark as (closed incomplete)
* Same time gets an INC to remove from AD (including Mac) – Auto triggered?
** Windows 11 – Nothing to Remove – close ticket (script to auto close)
** Apple Mac – No process to remove from Jamf etc.
** Windows 10 – Shane Ray script looks for present device and if it’s disabled – must be disabled first then automation to remove from AD (closes ticket)
* Windows 11 – If no interest in recovering device, could initiate Wipe on initial step.
** Does bitlocker encryption need to be completed prior to a Wipe? – Check first and get encrypted
** Does a device need to be in compliance to perform the wipe? – Not required

Maybe we mimic the Windows 11 from a flow perspective - https://libertymutual.service-now.com/esp?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0024288<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://libertymutual.service-now.com/esp?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0024288__;!!JJ-tOIoKdBzLSfV5jA!uD0SERiNsSUwhoPeYmeHIOMt8YduT6WD6h7cqXBpvevuJRi56mVXwNOCb7TNlWe3glW7rNFxdoV553DhaLBZmJfesUAmvZaBPKo$>

Let me know how much time you might need to build out this process? Stick in it in the IT-Secure and L2 only steps for this process/workflow.

# Retire ALL remaining Windows 10 articles from Knowledge environment
# Reach out to L1 thru Huddles or I/O and ask them to comment on ANY Windows 10 related scripting they find
## We need Tier 1 to assist with finding content that is buried within the articles that are Win10 specific
## Last push effort before EOY to finally retire remaining Win10 knowledge content

There is no process to create a Win11 Gold Disk, would be difficult to create a Win10 Gold Disk and then attempt to migrate to Win11 machine.

Need a documented process on what expectations manager will have if and when calling L1 with an older device that was previously provisioned for an employee no longer working for that manager.

This would include ANY hardware asset (Desktop, Laptop, Mac) - create a KB or process outlining what actions to take and provide info for managers to understand reasons why we don’t want to Hoard these devices.

* Device was handed to employee and not shipped directly to them (did it show up in a box?)
* Employee still working on Windows 10 laptop (not in exception group) - offer Win11 upgrade
* Manager calls in asking for a Windows 11 Gold Disk - ask manger to return device and order replacement for employee

Instructions should be to Return the Win10 to Deployment (regardless of model/type)

* Then ask customer to order a replacement Win11 device
* Let Hardware Asset management to determine

Solutions where these might be helpful to add L1 detailed steps to return device and order replacement:

Question(s):

# Do you have a report or dashboard that you can share with me to help monitor the emails being sent so I can compare with incident volume?
# Can you provide me with a copy of the 3 different emails examples (especially for the Down and Transit emails)
## Since the instructions on what to do are likely in the comm, it would be helpful to share this with Tech Help

Also, I got some feedback that maybe we develop a “myAsset Review - FAQ” type of page or knowledge article, I’m happy to build this out but will need your assistance to ensure content is accurate and maybe help with what we want to include and what not to include.

*What is Happening?*

As a part of Liberty’s enterprise modernization of the Privileged Access Management (PAM) strategy and technology, GCS IAM is implementing Delinea Secret Server (SS), a cloud-first, scalable, cost-effect, and resilient solution. Delinea SS will replace CyberArk enterprise password vault, *and the use-case that is migrating next is all remining Unix managed accounts.*  

*Why is it Happening? What is driving this work?*

To strengthen governance over privileged IT credentials, bolster security, and increase control and compliance.  This modernization propels efforts to Safeguard Business Operations, Digitalize our Future, and Make IT Spend Count. Delinea Secret Server will simplify workflows for managing privileged access, reducing complexity for both tech and business users.    

*Who is impacted/in-scope for this initiative?*

Attaching impact in the next few days.  Selecting all markets until we have final impact breakout.

*Market(s) Impacted*

* USRM
* GRS
* LIFTED
* GCS
* GDS

*What actions do those impacted need to take?*

The target migration date for remaining Unix Managed accounts is the end of February 2026.  Closer to the migration, additional communications with information and resources will be shared that will be catered towards this use-case.   

+Prepare to use Delinea SS+:  

* Adapt and get familiar with the new user experience in Delinea SS.    

* Prioritize time to test permissions prior to migration cutover.    

* Teams using automation (CyberArk APIs) will need to adjust their applications to switch over to Delinea SS APIs.    

+Action end users need during migration:+ 

* Review onboarding guide and FAQs - [https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GISDAC/pages/1596657260/Delinea+Connection+Manager|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GISDAC/pages/1596657260/Delinea+Connection+Manager|smart-link]  

* Verify you have access to migrated folder/safe in Delinea via: 

* Web portal 

* Install Delinea Connection Manager from Liberty App Portal and verify access 

* Test RDP connection after migration 

*What happens if required actions are not complete by the due date (i.e., business disruption, costs, etc.)?*

Lose access and lack of awareness with the new PAM process for Unix managed accounts. 

*Do you have an impact list (i.e., excel, report, etc.)?* Not at this time, but in progress

*What is Driving the Due Date? Why was this date selected?* CyberArk retirement in 2026. 

*Communications Strategy & Related Resources*

Impacted end-users and managers will get an email communication once we finish gathering data.

I'm working on the RAE Loss Lens Processing Service and need assistance with SSL certificate configuration for local development on my machine.
*Issue:* When running the service locally, I'm encountering SSL certificate verification errors when making HTTPS requests to Liberty's internal API endpoint:
*Endpoint:* [lm-cf-openai-api-tst01.apim.lmig.com|http://lm-cf-openai-api-tst01.apim.lmig.com] and various others
*Error:* [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate
*Context:*
This issue only occurs on my machine - my colleagues can run the service locally without SSL errors
I'm using Python 3.11 with the httpx library for HTTP requests on macOS on PyCharm. However, I’ve seen this error arise for Python 3.12 and 3.13 as well.
I have already gone through the Zscaler Developer Onboarding doc and have added the certificate file on PyCharm and have gone through the other Mac Setup instructions.
*What I Need:*
The appropriate CA certificate(s) to trust Liberty's internal domains (specifically *.apim.lmig.com)
Instructions on how to install/configure these certificates for local development on macOS
Confirmation on whether my local environment is missing something my colleagues have configured
*Repository:* lmigtech/rae-loss-lens-processing-service
Could you please provide guidance on obtaining and configuring the correct certificates for my local development environment?
Thank you!
Best regards,
Angela Cui

*What is Happening?*

In the beginning of 2026, we will commence our NAS cleanup initiative. The first phase will focus on cleaning up NFS volumes that is directly associated with Unix machines.

+Technical Context:+ NFS shares are hosted on NetApp storage systems, and their access is tightly coupled to Unix machines (both physical servers and virtual machines). Each NFS volume has specific client access ( in form of DNS names/IPs of unix machines)  permissions configured at the NetApp level.

This data-driven approach will enable us to safely offline volumes where all associated Unix machines are non-responsive, while selectively cleaning up individual clients for volumes with mixed connectivity status.

+Current State Analysis+

Based on comprehensive connectivity testing across the NetApp environment:

* Total Volumes Analyzed: 1,493 volumes
* Volumes with All associated client’s ping/DNS Failed Status: 809 volumes (54%)
* Logical Capacity of volumes where All associated client’s ping/DNS  Failed Volumes: 354.87 TiB (363,391 GiB)

+Strategic Approach+

Phase 1: Remove Inactive/Non-Pinging Clients from NFS Volumes

Objective: Safely offline or clean up NFS volumes where Unix client machines are no longer accessible.

Methodology:

* If all Unix machines associated with a volume are down → Take volume offline
* If only some machines are down → Clean up inactive clients only, leave volume active
* All decisions based on DNS resolution and ping connectivity tests

+Non-Production volumes+: Deleted 3 months after being offlined 

+Production volumes+: Deleted 6 months after being offlined 

*Why is it Happening? What is driving this work?*

+Benefits+:

* Immediate capacity reclamation potential: 354.87 TiB
* Reduced storage footprint and associated costs
* Improved storage performance and management
* Better understanding of actual data access patterns

*Who is impacted/in-scope for this initiative?*

There should be NO disruptions to any active applications. All actions are taken only on clients which are not active (unreachable or offline systems). We have verified the connectivity status of each client before determining the appropriate action. 

Active clients will continue to operate normally with no service interruption 

* Only inactive/unreachable clients will have their access permissions removed 
* Volumes serving active clients will remain online and fully operational 
* Volumes with no active clients will be offlined with appropriate grace periods before deletion 

+Backout+: In case of any issues, volumes can be quickly bring back online and access can be restored.

*Market(s) Impacted*

* USRM
* GRS
* LIFTED
* GCS
* GDS

*What actions do those impacted need to take?*

App owners will be informed via emails and will provide their specific volume list as well in that email, the email will have below actions for them to take. Please check email template here, [https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DPM/pages/1888718897/Email+Template+to+Volume+Owners|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DPM/pages/1888718897/Email+Template+to+Volume+Owners|smart-link]

+Next Steps for App Owners+: The specific action planned for each of your volumes is documented in the *""Next Action""* column of the attached volume summary report. 

* *Review*: Please review the attached volume summary report for your assigned volumes 
* *Validate*: Confirm the accuracy of the planned actions for each volume 
* *RESPOND - ACTION REQUIRED*: *Please open a service desk ticket within 15 business days using the link below in the following cases:* 
** If you want to retain a volume that is marked for Offlining
** If the Troux application/ID is retired but Unix clients are still active - you must update the Troux ID with the current active application
** If you believe an application or volume has been incorrectly assigned to you - update the ownership information 
** Any other questions or concerns

*What happens if required actions are not complete by the due date (i.e., business disruption, costs, etc.)?*

* Volumes with no active clients will be offlined with appropriate grace periods before deletion 
* Volumes serving active clients will remain online and fully operational 
* Non-Production volumes: Deleted 3 months after being offlined 
* Production volumes: Deleted 6 months after being offlined 

*Do you have an impact list (i.e., excel, report, etc.)?* Yes, [https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DPM/pages/1891238405/NFS+Cleanup+Initiative|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DPM/pages/1891238405/NFS+Cleanup+Initiative|smart-link]

* Do we have or should we have a document to share the min OS version for Mac assets
* Suggest that if we do this, we should broaden scope to ALL Assets (physical and virtual)
** Currently scope is they have a min. date to upgrade to min. OS version (current version)
* *EXAMPLE:* Comes back from Leave of absence - left on 15.6, now we are up to 15.8 version
** Mac was not on the network so never got the update
** Unable to work or function apps as it’s no longer min OS requirements
** Setting up meeting with Ashley and team to discuss further
*** Identify the issues and painpoints with both Windows and Mac
**** Not meeting min. OS Mac version - removal from Jamf
**** Not meeting min. security update on Windows - device sync issues

*What is Happening?*

As part of the KDC Exit initiative as we finish up the DR move to Columbus OH (CDC) we are shifting our focus to the big cutover from KDC to Ashburn VA (ADC). As part of this effort we are requesting that all application teams with workload running or calling workloads that run out of the KDC datacenter develop end to end validation plans, automation scripts etc. to ensure that during the upcoming KDC test/simulation cutover events and during the final cutover weekend teams will know how to perform a full application validation and signoff of their application post cutover to ADC.

*Why is it Happening? What is driving this work?*

Ultimately the KDC exit project is driving this request but the rational for this work is to enhance the cutover and minimize risk duing the cutover weekend

A datacenter cutover isn’t just a physical move of servers and network infrastructure. It involves changes to the underlying environment including power, network configurations, hardware, and potentially data access pathways. Even the most stable applications can behave differently after such transitions due to subtle environmental changes.

Validation helps us:

* *Confirm Application Availability:* Ensuring the app comes up properly in the new environment.
* *Verify Performance:* Catch any degradation in response times or throughput.
* *Check Integration Points:* Confirm connections to databases, APIs, and third-party services remain intact.
* *Identify Data Integrity Issues:* Validate that no data corruption or loss occurred during migration.

Without these checks, problems might only surface after the cutover, potentially causing downtime and ultimately impacting our business operations.

*Who is impacted/in-scope for this initiative?*

All applications identified in the KDC Exit effort and KDC asset inventory are in scope of this effort. [+[GCH-241] KDC Datacenter Migration and Exit by April of 2026 - Jira+|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/browse/GCH-241]

*Market(s) Impacted*

* USRM
* GRS
* CF/LIFTED
* GCS
* GDS

*What actions do those impacted need to take?*

To minimize risk and ensure business continuity, developers need to:

# *Document Current Application Architecture:* Understand and map out all components and dependencies.
# *Create a Validation Plan:* Define what to test, how to test it, and what success looks like.
# *Prepare Automated and Manual Tests:* Use existing test suites or build new ones tailored for the post-cutover environment.
# *Coordinate with Infrastructure Teams:* Align resources with the TBD test cutover schedules and fully understand any configuration changes needed for the apps.
# *Schedule Dry Runs or Staging Tests:* Whenever possible, test the application and validation plans in an environment that closely mirrors Ashburn colo and during the TBD test cutover schedules.
# *Plan for Rapid Issue Resolution:* Have support teams ready to troubleshoot and fix any issues immediately after cutover.

*What happens if required actions are not complete by the due date (i.e., business disruption, costs, etc.)?*

If the actions are not completed by this date, then we are at risk of delays in fixes and unforeseen issues that may arise during our test cycles and post cutover to the ADC datacenter from KDC. This could cause delays in signoff and longer lasting issues that could have been addressed prior to the cutover event.

*Do you have an impact list (i.e., excel, report, etc.)?* Yes, LPAR and VM inventory - [+In-Scope Migration to Ashburn.xlsx+|https://libertymutual.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/HSIntegrationsandDivestitures/Kansas%20City%20Datacenter%20Exit/1.%20Inventory%20%26%20Planning/Ashburn%20Datacenter/In-Scope%20Migration%20to%20Ashburn.xlsx?d=w4efe7fb39d9c47dc9287e4694ab5ea56&csf=1&web=1&e=GlqjWc]

*What is Driving the Due Date? Why was this date selected?*

The due date is being driven by the overall KDC exit program dates and by the start of 2026 we need to be ready to move into the test phase of the program with teams ready to test and validate applications in AWS for the scheduled test cycles and cutover event in April that can’t move.

*Where should I store this information about my application validation plans.*

We are asking all teams to use the following SharePoint site to store this information

*What is Happening?*

To align with LM's Tech strategic priority of safeguarding business operations, BladeLogic (BL) will be retiring with a target date of mid-October 2025.

* Read-Only & Root BL roles will be move to a standard Privileged Access Management (PAM) pattern utilizing Delinea Secret Server (SS), a cloud-first, scalable, cost-effective, and resilient solution.    

*Why is it Happening? What is driving this work?*

BladeLogic is legacy, unsupported, and has risk findings associated with the environment.  

*Who is impacted/in-scope for this initiative?*

The target migration date is mid-October.  Closer to the migration, additional communications with information and resources will be shared that will be catered towards this migration.  We will ensure a testing period where both patterns will be available prior to BladeLogic shutdown to minimize impact.

*Market(s) Impacted*

* USRM
* GRS
* CF/LIFTED
* GCS
* GDS

*What actions do those impacted need to take?*

Closer to migration, prepare to use Delinea SS:

* Additional validation on use-cases and requirements may be needed. 
* Adapt and get familiar with the new user experiences. 
* Prioritize time to test permissions prior to migration cutover. 

Impacted end-users, managers, and POs will get an email communication once we have more information and directions to ensure end-users have proper access. Office-hours will be held leading up to the migration for testing and questions, with hypercare support provided after BladeLogic shutdown. 

*What happens if required actions are not complete by the due date (i.e., business disruption, costs, etc.)?*

Lose access and lack of awareness with the new process for BladeLogic replacement.

*Do you have an impact list (i.e., excel, report, etc.)?* Not at this time, but in progress

*What is Driving the Due Date? Why was this date selected?*

Patch management not possible leaving us exposed to current and future security risks and lack of vendor support.

AWS WAF Everywhere: All Externally Facing AWS resources must be protected by a Web Application Firewall (WAF),GCH-520,18503170,Story,In Progress,GCH,GCS & GDS Market Action Center - Horizons,software,Luke Hillebrand,61ee354f5a0988006b190ae3,,,Minor,,,,KRIS WILSON,61eeabb125edab006af95cfa,KRIS WILSON,61eeabb125edab006af95cfa,19/Dec/25 9:32 AM,13/Feb/26 1:30 PM,,,,,Action Required,,02/Mar/26 12:00 AM,0,GCS,GDS,GRS,LIFTED,Updated,USRM,,,,,,,,,,"*Originating Market* - GCS Global Security Services (GSS) - Architecture

*What is Happening?*

All externally facing AWS resources will be required to be protected by a Web Application Firewall. Resource types in scope for this effort:

* AWS API Gateway REST APIs (Edge and Regional)
* AWS CloudFront
* -Application Load Balancer- (removed from scope)
* AWS AppSync GraphQL API
* Amazon Cognito user pool
* AWS Amplify

*Why is it Happening? What is driving this work?*

Having AWS resources that are not protected by a WAF significantly increases the risk of account compromise and data breach. By requiring that these resources leverage the appropriate CSPE-managed WAF policy, we can significantly reduce that risk.

*Who is impacted/in-scope for this initiative?*

Any owners of AWS resources that are not currently protected by a WAF

*Market(s) Impacted*

* USRM
* GRS
* LIFTED
* GCS
* GDS

*What actions do those impacted need to take?*

There are two categories of resources we will be addressing: existing and net-new resources.

+Action required for Existing Resources:+

# The GDS CSPE (Content Security and Performance Engineering) team will deploy internal and external WebACLs to any accounts identified as unprotected (resources currently without WAF protection)
# Resource owners will need to apply the “intended_exposure” tag to their resource
# Resource owners will need to associate the appropriate WebACL to their resource to become compliant.

+Action required for Net-New Resources+: Following this change, Radar will require the following actions to create a new resource:

# Upon creation, resource owner will need to add the correct “intended_exposure” tag to their resource
# Resource owner must associate a CSPE-managed WebACL to their resource. The WebACL applied must match the “intended_exposure” tag (ex. If a resource is tagged as intended_exposure = internet_facing, it must have an external WebACL associated).

*What happens if required actions are not complete by the due date (i.e., business disruption, costs, etc.)?*

+Existing resources+: If no action is taken, the resources will be flagged as non-compliant by radar, but will not be destroyed

+Net-new Resources+: If net-new resources do not follow the Radar rule requirements, they will be destroyed. New resources will only be allowed to be created if they follow these actions:

# Add “intended_exposure” tag
# Associate appropriate CSPE-managed WebACL

*Do you have an impact list (i.e., excel, report, etc.)?* Resource owners can check their compliance status using this sample CloudForge Discovery Radar Compliance Report: [https://discovery.lmig.com/sqlpad/queries/e4e02649-1df8-4532-825a-8a03ad96a1c6|https://discovery.lmig.com/sqlpad/queries/e4e02649-1df8-4532-825a-8a03ad96a1c6]

*What is Driving the Due Date? Why was this date selected?*

Teams should begin inventorying and planning immediate remediation now (tagging, IaC changes, associating WebACLs).

+Enforcement Schedule - Destructive remediation for newly created resources:+

* {{2026-03-02}} — SANDBOX/DEV: Radar enforcement (enforce WebACL association; non‑compliant new resources destroyed).
* {{2026-03-16}} — NON‑PROD: Radar enforcement begins (2‑week interval).
* {{2026-03-30}} — PROD: Radar enforcement begins (2‑week interval).

+Existing non‑compliant resources (owner remediation):+ Radar will not auto‑destroy existing non‑compliant resources during this remediation window but leave remediation tasks up to the affected teams

It actually is externally facing only.  By externally facing, we mean a resource reachable from the Internet.  So, the scope is externally facing AWS resources that support WAF.

 

There’s confusion with the terminology, because we have target systems that are intended to be internal, but are reachable through some of these externally facing resources.  Like API Gateway.  So the flow is Internet à API Gateway à VPC resource such as an EC2 instance.  So, we have “internal” WAF policies that allow access to externally facing resources like API Gateway, but use network ACLs to limit access from Liberty Mutual public IP addresses only.  But the resource in scope for WAF Everywhere, the API Gateway, is externally facing.

 

The subject should be All externally facing AWS resources. I will make that update now. Thanks for raising this!","20/Jan/26 9:54 AM;62fec9adeec8d4a478d522cb;Hi,

I have run the SQL pad query from the communities post for our Troux ID - E2492DFE-57A8-4F76-BCE6-3A9F33098B77 - and only one came back non-compliant. Is this the only one we need to worry about?

The rest of the compliant resources already use internally facing acls eg aws-cloudfront-webacl-internal-block-dev-v1. Do we still need to switch our resources over to use the CSPE managed ones since they’re currently compliant or will they become non-compliant as a result?

*What is Happening?*

The Observability team coordinated with the Secrets Management team to rotate the key the Datadog AP key stored in teh global secret. The current key will be revoked on March 6, 2026. Teams have until that date to redeploy and pick up the new key.

*Why is it Happening? What is driving this work?*

On November 26, 2025, the Datadog API key stored in the global secret was exposed publicly. The Observability team coordinated with the Secrets Management team to rotate the key. The exposed key will be revoked on March 6, 2026.

*Who is impacted/in-scope for this initiative?*

All application teams using the global Datadog API key documented [+HERE+|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SECMAN/pages/1014547796/Global+Secrets] must redeploy their applications so they pick up the rotated key.

*Market(s) Impacted*

* USRM
* GRS
* LIFTED
* GCS
* GDS

*What actions do those impacted need to take?*

A redeploy of an application using Datadog any time before March 6th will pick up the rotated key with no disruption in service.  For any applications currently part of the 90 day redeploy cycle this will be completed in time.  For those that are exempt from 90 day redeploys a manual redeploy should resolve to the issue.

*What happens if required actions are not complete by the due date (i.e., business disruption, costs, etc.)?*

If you do not redeploy by March 6, 2026, your application’s observability logs, metrics and traces will stop being sent to Datadog.

*Do you have an impact list (i.e., excel, report, etc.)?* Yes

*What is Happening?*

API Management platform will enforce modern authentication for all external APIs by 3/31/26. The deployment process will Fail (exception required) for externally facing proxies that do not implement OAuth (Apigee, Azure, Ping).  See more details in wiki:

*Why is it Happening? What is driving this work?*

To ensure we are delivering a secure, enterprise-grade API Management platform that aligns with  cybersecurity regulations and External API Security Standards- ensuring compliance, protecting sensitive data, and enabling trusted digital innovation. 

*Who is impacted/in-scope for this initiative?*

Externally facing proxies that do not implement an acceptable form of OAuth (Apigee, Azure, Ping) 

*What actions do those impacted need to take?*

Proxy owners need to switch to a different type of Authentication Pattern.

* Coordinate with GS to send an OAuth token. They would call [https://api.us.libertymutual.com/oauth/token|https://api.us.libertymutual.com/oauth/token] to get a token for the proxy.

* Switch from using 'verify-api-key' to 'verify-oauth-v2-access-token' policy.
* NB: for reference the default proxy in groundspeed-x-proxy (/groundspeed) uses the ‘verify-oauth-v2-access-token’ policy (Apigee Oauth)

*What is Happening?*

API Management platform will enforce modern authentication for all external APIs by 3/31/26. The deployment process will Fail (exception required) for externally facing proxies that do not implement OAuth (Apigee, Azure, Ping).  See more details in wiki:

*Why is it Happening? What is driving this work?*

To ensure we are delivering a secure, enterprise-grade API Management platform that aligns with  cybersecurity regulations and External API Security Standards- ensuring compliance, protecting sensitive data, and enabling trusted digital innovation. 

*Who is impacted/in-scope for this initiative?*

Externally facing proxies that do not implement an acceptable form of OAuth (Apigee, Azure, Ping) 

*What actions do those impacted need to take?*

Proxy owners need to switch to a different type of Authentication Pattern. Guidance can be found here: [https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENTAPI/pages/330236398/Proxy+Authorization+Requirement+and+IDP+Selection+Guidance|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENTAPI/pages/330236398/Proxy+Authorization+Requirement+and+IDP+Selection+Guidance|smart-link] 

*What happens if required actions are not complete by the due date (i.e., business disruption, costs, etc.)?*

New deployments targeting new or existing proxy revisions will fail and display a message to the user instructing them to remediate or seek [+an exception+|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/150/group/1024].

To use the Power BI report, filter API Type = API Key and keep the 'external_endpoint” filter selected.

*What is Driving the Due Date? Why was this date selected?*

To comply with GCS recommendations for risk remediation. Timeline is also driven by a requirement to close and ELT reportable Audit finding.

Modern Auth Enforcement for External (Apigee) APIs – Legal Tech
*Originating Market* – GDS 

*What is Happening?*

API Management platform will enforce modern authentication for all external APIs by 3/31/26. The deployment process will Fail (exception required) for externally facing proxies that do not implement OAuth (Apigee, Azure, Ping).  See more details in wiki: 

[Proxy Authorization Requirement and IDP Selection Guidance - Enterprise API - Confluence|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENTAPI/pages/330236398/Proxy+Authorization+Requirement+and+IDP+Selection+Guidance] 



*Why is it Happening? What is driving this work?*

To ensure we are delivering a secure, enterprise-grade API Management platform that aligns with  cybersecurity regulations and External API Security Standards- ensuring compliance, protecting sensitive data, and enabling trusted digital innovation. 

*Who is impacted/in-scope for this initiative?*

Externally facing proxies that do not implement an acceptable form of OAuth (Apigee, Azure, Ping)

*What actions do those impacted need to take?*

Proxy owners need to switch to a different type of Authentication Pattern.

*What happens if required actions are not complete by the due date (i.e., business disruption, costs, etc.)?*

New deployments targeting new or existing proxy revisions will fail and display a message to the user instructing them to remediate or seek [an exception|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/150/group/1024]. 



*Do you have an impact list (i.e., excel, report, etc.)?* Yes, [https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/a8fd2dda-b5e3-4fc2-bb23-bc5ae50efb05/ReportSection5d01a4e0cea1cb302005?experience=power-bi|https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/a8fd2dda-b5e3-4fc2-bb23-bc5ae50efb05/ReportSection5d01a4e0cea1cb302005?experience=power-bi|smart-link] . To use the Power BI report, filter API Type = API Key and keep the 'external_endpoint” filter selected.



*What is Driving the Due Date? Why was this date selected?*

To comply with GCS recommendations for risk remediation. Timeline is also driven by a requirement to close and ELT reportable Audit finding.

* Reduces the chance of unauthorized access to Liberty Mutual systems and sensitive data through external connections
* Meets required security and audit commitments, avoiding reportable findings and related remediation work
* Improves accountability and oversight by clearly tying external usage back to approved partners and applications

{panel:bgColor=#fffae6}
h4. Impact / Risk if the change is not made on time:

* External connections may become difficult or impossible to update, causing delays to fixes, enhancements, and releases
* Increased risk of audit issues and security non-compliance, leading to escalations, exceptions, and unplanned work
* Higher likelihood of exposure from weaker access controls on external connections, with potential legal, financial, and reputational impact

*What is Happening?*

API Management platform will enforce modern authentication for all external APIs by 3/31/26. The deployment process will Fail (exception required) for externally facing proxies that do not implement OAuth (Apigee, Azure, Ping).  See more details in wiki: 

[+Proxy Authorization Requirement and IDP Selection Guidance - Enterprise API - Confluence+|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENTAPI/pages/330236398/Proxy+Authorization+Requirement+and+IDP+Selection+Guidance] 

+Change Dates:+ 

* *Dev/Test: 2/8/26*  
** Enforcement will be implemented in the Dev and Test Apigee Organizations. Any proxies not remediated will be impacted with this change)  
* *Prod: 3/8/26* 
** Enforcement will be implemented in the Prod Apigee Organizations. Any proxies not remediated will be impacted with this change) 

*Why is it Happening? What is driving this work?*

To ensure we are delivering a secure, enterprise-grade API Management platform that aligns with  cybersecurity regulations and External API Security Standards- ensuring compliance, protecting sensitive data, and enabling trusted digital innovation. 

*Who is impacted/in-scope for this initiative?*

Externally facing proxies that do not implement an acceptable form of OAuth (Apigee, Azure, Ping) 

*What actions do those impacted need to take?*

Proxy owners need to switch to a different type of Authentication Pattern. Guidance can be found here: [https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENTAPI/pages/330236398/Proxy+Authorization+Requirement+and+IDP+Selection+Guidance|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENTAPI/pages/330236398/Proxy+Authorization+Requirement+and+IDP+Selection+Guidance|smart-link] 

*What happens if required actions are not complete by the due date (i.e., business disruption, costs, etc.)?*

New deployments targeting new or existing proxy revisions will fail and display a message to the user instructing them to remediate or seek [+an exception+|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/150/group/1024]. 

*Do you have an impact list (i.e., excel, report, etc.)?* Yes, [https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/a8fd2dda-b5e3-4fc2-bb23-bc5ae50efb05/ReportSection5d01a4e0cea1cb302005?experience=power-bi|https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/a8fd2dda-b5e3-4fc2-bb23-bc5ae50efb05/ReportSection5d01a4e0cea1cb302005?experience=power-bi|smart-link]. To use the Power BI report, filter API Type = API Key and keep the 'external_endpoint” filter selected.

*What is Driving the Due Date? Why was this date selected?*

To comply with GCS recommendations for risk remediation. Timeline is also driven by a requirement to close and ELT reportable Audit finding.

*Why is it Happening? What is driving this work?*

To ensure we are delivering a secure, enterprise-grade API Management platform that aligns with  cybersecurity regulations and External API Security Standards- ensuring compliance, protecting sensitive data, and enabling trusted digital innovation. 

*Who is impacted/in-scope for this initiative?*

Externally facing proxies that do not implement an acceptable form of OAuth (Apigee, Azure, Ping) 

*What actions do those impacted need to take?*

Proxy owners need to switch to a different type of Authentication Pattern.

h4. Business Value / Benefit of making this change:

* Reduces the chance of unauthorized access to Liberty Mutual systems and sensitive data through external connections
* Meets required security and audit commitments, avoiding reportable findings and related remediation work
* Improves accountability and oversight by clearly tying external usage back to approved partners and applications

 _This content was generated by LibertyGPT and should be reviewed for accuracy._

{panel:bgColor=#fffae6}
h4. Impact / Risk if the change is not made on time:

* External connections may become difficult or impossible to update, causing delays to fixes, enhancements, and releases
* Increased risk of audit issues and security non-compliance, leading to escalations, exceptions, and unplanned work
* Higher likelihood of exposure from weaker access controls on external connections, with potential legal, financial, and reputational impact

Modern Auth Enforcement for External (Apigee) APIs – SS 

*Originating Market* – GDS 

*What is Happening?*

API Management platform will enforce modern authentication for all external APIs by 3/31/26. The deployment process will Fail (exception required) for externally facing proxies that do not implement OAuth (Apigee, Azure, Ping).  See more details in wiki: 

[Proxy Authorization Requirement and IDP Selection Guidance - Enterprise API - Confluence|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENTAPI/pages/330236398/Proxy+Authorization+Requirement+and+IDP+Selection+Guidance] 



*Why is it Happening? What is driving this work?*

To ensure we are delivering a secure, enterprise-grade API Management platform that aligns with  cybersecurity regulations and External API Security Standards- ensuring compliance, protecting sensitive data, and enabling trusted digital innovation. 

*Who is impacted/in-scope for this initiative?*

Externally facing proxies that do not implement an acceptable form of OAuth (Apigee, Azure, Ping) 

*Market(s) Impacted*

* USRM
* GRS
* CF/LIFTED
* GCS
* GDS

 

*Timeline:*

* *Dev/Test: 2/8/26*  
** Enforcement will be implemented in the Dev and Test Apigee Organizations. Any proxies not remediated will be impacted with this change)  
* *Prod: 3/8/26* 
** Enforcement will be implemented in the Prod Apigee Organizations. Any proxies not remediated will be impacted with this change)

 Analytic Platforms & Services (Brown): Unknown

 Legal Technology (Szostak): Unknown

 Global Finance Technology (Taylor): Unknown

 Global T&ES (Bradfish): Unknown

 Strategy & Shared Services (Butler): Unknown

 

*What actions do those impacted need to take?*

Proxy owners need to switch to a different type of Authentication Pattern. Guidance can be found here: [https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENTAPI/pages/330236398/Proxy+Authorization+Requirement+and+IDP+Selection+Guidance|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENTAPI/pages/330236398/Proxy+Authorization+Requirement+and+IDP+Selection+Guidance|smart-link]    



*What happens if required actions are not complete by the due date (i.e., business disruption, costs, etc.)?*

New deployments targeting new or existing proxy revisions will fail and display a message to the user instructing them to remediate or seek [an exception|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/150/group/1024]. 



*Do you have an impact list (i.e., excel, report, etc.)?* Yes, [https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/a8fd2dda-b5e3-4fc2-bb23-bc5ae50efb05/ReportSection5d01a4e0cea1cb302005?experience=power-bi|https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/a8fd2dda-b5e3-4fc2-bb23-bc5ae50efb05/ReportSection5d01a4e0cea1cb302005?experience=power-bi|smart-link] . To use the Power BI report, filter API Type = API Key and keep the 'external_endpoint” filter selected.



*What is Driving the Due Date? Why was this date selected?*

To comply with GCS recommendations for risk remediation. Timeline is also driven by a requirement to close and ELT reportable Audit finding.

Modern Auth Enforcement for External (Apigee) APIs – SS 

*Originating Market* – GDS 

*What is Happening?*

API Management platform will enforce modern authentication for all external APIs by 3/31/26. The deployment process will Fail (exception required) for externally facing proxies that do not implement OAuth (Apigee, Azure, Ping).  See more details in wiki: 

[Proxy Authorization Requirement and IDP Selection Guidance - Enterprise API - Confluence|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENTAPI/pages/330236398/Proxy+Authorization+Requirement+and+IDP+Selection+Guidance] 



*Why is it Happening? What is driving this work?*

To ensure we are delivering a secure, enterprise-grade API Management platform that aligns with  cybersecurity regulations and External API Security Standards- ensuring compliance, protecting sensitive data, and enabling trusted digital innovation. 

*Who is impacted/in-scope for this initiative?*

Externally facing proxies that do not implement an acceptable form of OAuth (Apigee, Azure, Ping) 

*Market(s) Impacted*

* USRM
* GRS
* CF/LIFTED
* GCS
* GDS

 

*Timeline:*

* *Dev/Test: 2/8/26*  
** Enforcement will be implemented in the Dev and Test Apigee Organizations. Any proxies not remediated will be impacted with this change)  
* *Prod: 3/8/26* 
** Enforcement will be implemented in the Prod Apigee Organizations. Any proxies not remediated will be impacted with this change)

 Analytic Platforms & Services (Brown): Unknown

 Legal Technology (Szostak): Unknown

 Global Finance Technology (Taylor): Unknown

 Global T&ES (Bradfish): Unknown

 Strategy & Shared Services (Butler): Unknown

 

*What actions do those impacted need to take?*

Proxy owners need to switch to a different type of Authentication Pattern. Guidance can be found here: [https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENTAPI/pages/330236398/Proxy+Authorization+Requirement+and+IDP+Selection+Guidance|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENTAPI/pages/330236398/Proxy+Authorization+Requirement+and+IDP+Selection+Guidance|smart-link]    



*What happens if required actions are not complete by the due date (i.e., business disruption, costs, etc.)?*

New deployments targeting new or existing proxy revisions will fail and display a message to the user instructing them to remediate or seek [an exception|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/150/group/1024]. 



*Do you have an impact list (i.e., excel, report, etc.)?* Yes, [https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/a8fd2dda-b5e3-4fc2-bb23-bc5ae50efb05/ReportSection5d01a4e0cea1cb302005?experience=power-bi|https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/a8fd2dda-b5e3-4fc2-bb23-bc5ae50efb05/ReportSection5d01a4e0cea1cb302005?experience=power-bi|smart-link] . To use the Power BI report, filter API Type = API Key and keep the 'external_endpoint” filter selected.



*What is Driving the Due Date? Why was this date selected?*

To comply with GCS recommendations for risk remediation. Timeline is also driven by a requirement to close and ELT reportable Audit finding. 

*Communications Strategy & Related Resources*

MAC ticket to inform proxy owners. Resources will be created to help proxy owners implement changes.

Modern Auth Enforcement for External (Apigee) APIs – EDATA 2025-12-10 - 2026-03-08 -A-Team Rob Fauci  & Simo ES Salehy 

CFTHOR-4917
Modern Auth Enforcement for External (Apigee) APIs – EDATA
*Originating Market* – GDS 

*What is Happening?*

API Management platform will enforce modern authentication for all external APIs by 3/31/26. The deployment process will Fail (exception required) for externally facing proxies that do not implement OAuth (Apigee, Azure, Ping).  See more details in wiki:

*Why is it Happening? What is driving this work?*

To ensure we are delivering a secure, enterprise-grade API Management platform that aligns with  cybersecurity regulations and External API Security Standards- ensuring compliance, protecting sensitive data, and enabling trusted digital innovation. 

*Who is impacted/in-scope for this initiative?*

Externally facing proxies that do not implement an acceptable form of OAuth (Apigee, Azure, Ping)

*What actions do those impacted need to take?*

Proxy owners need to switch to a different type of Authentication Pattern.

*What happens if required actions are not complete by the due date (i.e., business disruption, costs, etc.)?*

New deployments targeting new or existing proxy revisions will fail and display a message to the user instructing them to remediate or seek [an exception|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/150/group/1024]. 



*Do you have an impact list (i.e., excel, report, etc.)?* Yes, [https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/a8fd2dda-b5e3-4fc2-bb23-bc5ae50efb05/ReportSection5d01a4e0cea1cb302005?experience=power-bi|https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/a8fd2dda-b5e3-4fc2-bb23-bc5ae50efb05/ReportSection5d01a4e0cea1cb302005?experience=power-bi|smart-link] . To use the Power BI report, filter API Type = API Key and keep the 'external_endpoint” filter selected.



*What is Driving the Due Date? Why was this date selected?*

To comply with GCS recommendations for risk remediation. Timeline is also driven by a requirement to close and ELT reportable Audit finding.

Modern Auth Enforcement for External (Apigee) APIs – Legal Tech
*Originating Market* – GDS 

*What is Happening?*

API Management platform will enforce modern authentication for all external APIs by 3/31/26. The deployment process will Fail (exception required) for externally facing proxies that do not implement OAuth (Apigee, Azure, Ping).  See more details in wiki: 

[Proxy Authorization Requirement and IDP Selection Guidance - Enterprise API - Confluence|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENTAPI/pages/330236398/Proxy+Authorization+Requirement+and+IDP+Selection+Guidance] 



*Why is it Happening? What is driving this work?*

To ensure we are delivering a secure, enterprise-grade API Management platform that aligns with  cybersecurity regulations and External API Security Standards- ensuring compliance, protecting sensitive data, and enabling trusted digital innovation. 

*Who is impacted/in-scope for this initiative?*

Externally facing proxies that do not implement an acceptable form of OAuth (Apigee, Azure, Ping) 

*Market(s) Impacted*

* USRM
* GRS
* CF/LIFTED
* GCS
* GDS

 

*Timeline:*

* *Dev/Test: 2/8/26*  
** Enforcement will be implemented in the Dev and Test Apigee Organizations. Any proxies not remediated will be impacted with this change)  
* *Prod: 3/8/26* 
** Enforcement will be implemented in the Prod Apigee Organizations. Any proxies not remediated will be impacted with this change)

 Analytic Platforms & Services (Brown): Unknown

 Legal Technology (Szostak): Unknown

 Global Finance Technology (Taylor): Unknown

 Global T&ES (Bradfish): Unknown

 Strategy & Shared Services (Butler): Unknown

 

*What actions do those impacted need to take?*

Proxy owners need to switch to a different type of Authentication Pattern. Guidance can be found here: [https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENTAPI/pages/330236398/Proxy+Authorization+Requirement+and+IDP+Selection+Guidance|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENTAPI/pages/330236398/Proxy+Authorization+Requirement+and+IDP+Selection+Guidance|smart-link]    



*What happens if required actions are not complete by the due date (i.e., business disruption, costs, etc.)?*

New deployments targeting new or existing proxy revisions will fail and display a message to the user instructing them to remediate or seek [an exception|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/150/group/1024]. 



*Do you have an impact list (i.e., excel, report, etc.)?* Yes, [https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/a8fd2dda-b5e3-4fc2-bb23-bc5ae50efb05/ReportSection5d01a4e0cea1cb302005?experience=power-bi|https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/a8fd2dda-b5e3-4fc2-bb23-bc5ae50efb05/ReportSection5d01a4e0cea1cb302005?experience=power-bi|smart-link] . To use the Power BI report, filter API Type = API Key and keep the 'external_endpoint” filter selected.



*What is Driving the Due Date? Why was this date selected?*

To comply with GCS recommendations for risk remediation. Timeline is also driven by a requirement to close and ELT reportable Audit finding. 

*Communications Strategy & Related Resources*

MAC ticket to inform proxy owners. Resources will be created to help proxy owners implement changes.

*What is Happening?*

The vendor has begun enforcing API token expirations, including any legacy API tokens created prior to December 15, 2024. The API tokens created before December 15, 2024, are backfilled to expire in one year. These API tokens will expire between March 14 and May 12, 2026.

*Why is it Happening? What is driving this work?*

The vendor is enforcing API expiration dates. This helps strengthen our security posture by enforcing the rotation of api keys.

*Who is impacted/in-scope for this initiative?*

Users and system accounts that have created API tokens before December 15, 2024 will need to create a new API token if needed and update any downstream automation/systems that are consuming that token.

*Market(s) Impacted*

* USRM
* GRS
* LIFTED
* GCS
* GDS

*What actions do those impacted need to take?*

There are roughly 145 API tokens that were created before December 2024 that have a date last used that has a date of 2025. If those API tokens are important, they will need to be recreated and replaced where current API tokens are being used. How to create a new token can be found here: [https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/|https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/|smart-link]

*What happens if required actions are not complete by the due date (i.e., business disruption, costs, etc.)?*

If no action is taken, the API token will expire and will no longer return any Atlassian data after the expiration date.

*Do you have an impact list (i.e., excel, report, etc.)?* Yes, see attached.

*What is Driving the Due Date? Why was this date selected?*

Vendor selected the date. Legacy API tokens have been backfilled with an expiry date starting on {{2026-03-13}}

*What is Happening?*
Falcon cloud SSL/TLS certificates for US-1, US-2, EU-1 and US-GOV-1, which terminate the sensor to cloud TLS connection, will be rotated on March 16, 2026, in advance of a scheduled certificate expiration.

*Why is it Happening?*
These rotations are part of CrowdStrike’s commitment to ensuring the continued authenticity and integrity of the sensor’s cryptographic trust model.

*Who is Impacted/In Scope for this Initiative?*
Application teams using AMIs with an older sensor version will be impacted.  A list of AWS accounts deploying AMIs with older sensor versions is provided below.  Please note not all AMIs built under these accounts will be affected by this certificate rotation.

*Market(s) Impacted?* - USRM, GRS, LIFTED, GCS, GDS

*What Actions do those impacted need to take?*
Update build process to use the current standard Liberty Mutual AMI, OR update your build process to use the newest version of the Falcon sensor located here: 
[https://libertymutual-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/p/henry_carr/IgDmHj4m5m_hRavTbL8aut_zARLOaHGmdcib_LV6KBn7m80|https://libertymutual-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/p/henry_carr/IgDmHj4m5m_hRavTbL8aut_zARLOaHGmdcib_LV6KBn7m80]

*What happens if required actions are not complete by the due date??*
Failure to update the Falcon sensor version will result in loss of security protection and lost visibility of the instances. 

*Do you have an impact list?* Yes, [https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HES/pages/2051015442/AWS+accounts+with+outdated+AMIs+public|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HES/pages/2051015442/AWS+accounts+with+outdated+AMIs+public|smart-link]

I think the main thing we need is a list of every patched version of every AMI.  Then, we can tie back to app name using the discovery portal pretty easily.  Currently I see AMIs like ""lm-base-windows-2022-1.0.18"" and ""grs-win-2016-20220617-1.0.0-33"", but the MAC ticket does not indicate which versions of those are the ones we need to upgrade to.","10/Feb/26 4:15 PM;712020:9c103f46-280b-4e92-9acb-7d1f0497f2c5;[~accountid:61ee7e341c42100069372472] unfortunately the only data we have is the overarching AWS accounts. The data tied to individual out of date AMIs already expires in the discovery tool by the time we try to correlate it. 

The best we could do is tie the AWS account point of contact with the market they work in.

But we need to know which AMI version has the updated Crowdstrike Falcon Sensor installation. For example you posted in another comment that “lm-base-ubuntu-2204-1.0.38” has the patched version. I know my team has an EC2 running “lm-base-ubuntu-2204-1.0.38” so I know that one is compliant, but if I were to find an EC2 running “lm-base-ubuntu-2204-1.0.*37*” or lower I would assume that needs to be updated to “lm-base-ubuntu-2204-1.0.38”. However we haven’t seen a list of patched versions for ""lm-base-windows-2022-1.0.X"" and ""grs-win-2016-20220617-1.0.0-X"" which are two of the AMIs we’re using and potentially need to be upgraded. I would imagine the list of AMI’s is not something that we would need discovery for and wouldn’t change after initial release - is the mid range team who you reached out to before and provided Ubunut/AL/RedHat able to share a similar list for Windows / all other OS’s?","10/Feb/26 4:52 PM;712020:9c103f46-280b-4e92-9acb-7d1f0497f2c5;[~accountid:70121:03aca3f8-6121-4fa9-8ec9-5d369975c590] yes, that list came from the mid-range team.

*What is Happening?*

We are retiring the Troux SaaS product and building and building a UI replacement for a short-term tactical plan.

* Training for users (Admin, IT Owners, Stewards, Market Leads) will be in the form of a new APM Knowledge Center, which will be ready on 3/9 for the cutover
* Users in system 3/9

*Why is it Happening? What is driving this work?*

+Significant Technology Risk+

* Ongoing stability and performance issues
* Collectors failing weekly
* System crashes during server clean-up
* Data quality issues
* Outdated technology
* Limited subject matter expertise

+Financial Uncertainty with Vendor+

* Unknown cost or commitment term if we need to renew this contract in April 2026

+Unintended Usage beyond APM+

* Troux now supports broader use cases; recent examples include myAccess and Power Automate.
* Metadata fields have been repurposed for non-APM needs; e.g.“External Facing”

*Who is impacted/in-scope for this initiative?*

Users of the Troux SaaS application

There are a very limited number of applications that are impacted by this initiative. Those application owners are aware and are a part of the initiative. 

Most data our LM applications use flow from Troux to ITODS, reports pulling “Troux Data” are actually pulling from ITODS and will not be affected by this initiative.

*Market(s) Impacted*

* USRM
* GRS
* CF/LIFTED
* GCS
* GDS

*What actions do those impacted need to take?*

No action at the moment, we will have training for Troux users only in 2026

*What happens if required actions are not complete by the due date (i.e., business disruption, costs, etc.)?* N/A

*Do you have an impact list (i.e., excel, report, etc.)? Yes, see attached* (Impacted parties have already been contacted and have been collaborating with Troux team)

*Troux Retirement Update*

 

Dear Troux Users & Stakeholders,

As part of our ongoing efforts to improve the way we manage our application portfolio and technology assets at LM, I want to share an important update regarding our work to retire the Troux application.

We are retiring Troux and migrating its data into CloudForge Console, LeanIX, and ServiceNow. This affects everyone who maintains or consumes APM/application data.

 

*Our progress*

Our goal remains to ensure a smooth transition to our new APM MVP solution with minimal downstream data impacts.  Over the last few months, our teams have:

* Worked with market leads to assess our current APM practices and identified enterprise-wide dependencies on Troux.
* Designed a new APM user interface (UI) within CloudForge Console to provide a better experience for those maintaining application data.

A message from AJ Wasserman

 Troux Retirement Update

Last year we shared plans to retire Troux and replace it with a more sustainable Application Portfolio Management (APM) solution. I’m pleased to report the new APM tool is nearly ready, and we have set the formal cutover date.

Key information and next steps
•	Cutover date: Monday, March 9, 2026. This is the date when:  
o	The new CloudForge Console User Interface (UI) becomes the APM system of record.
o	ServiceNow becomes the system of record for Application-to-Server Relationships.
o	LeanIX becomes the system of record for Application Enterprise Architecture metadata.
o	From March 9 onward: Do not create or update any Applications in the Troux Product, including Application-to-Server relationships. All APM activities must be initiated and maintained in the new Console UI and all Application-to-Server relationships must be managed in ServiceNow.

•	Process changes: The new system will alter current workflows. We have coordinated closely with Market (SBU) Leads to design a smooth transition and to limit data disruption. If you have access to Troux, you will have access to the new APM system.
•	SBU responsibilities: Your SBU Lead remains your primary contact for any organization-specific APM procedures and approvals. Engage them first for process-related questions.
•	Resources: Visit the APM Knowledge Management area in Console for an APM overview, links to ‘how-to’ resources, and SBU-specific process pages. Check them before contacting your SBU Lead.
•	Support and feedback: We appreciate your partnership as we modernize our APM capabilities and Make IT Spend Count. If you encounter issues, have concerns, or want to share feedback, reach out through the support channels listed in the APM Knowledge Management area or contact Suzanne Meeves.

What we ask of you
•	Review: Audit any active processes, reports, or integrations that reference Troux on or after 3/9.
•	Prepare: Plan to transition day-to-day APM activities to the Console UI on 3/9.
•	Do not use Troux after 3/9, reach out to your SBU Lead or Suzanne Meeves with any questions.

Thank you for your support and cooperation as we complete this critical modernization.
If you have immediate questions, please consult the APM Knowledge Management area in Console or contact your Market(SBU) APM Lead.

AJ Wasserman

Wiz Vulns added to Vuln Workbench for EC2 Instances w/o a Tenable Agent ,GCH-519,18480552,Story,In Progress,GCH,GCS & GDS Market Action Center - Horizons,software,Luke Hillebrand,61ee354f5a0988006b190ae3,,,Minor,,,,Emily Proulx,62fed12f1e82e839c250c0d7,Emily Proulx,62fed12f1e82e839c250c0d7,16/Dec/25 11:43 AM,28/Jan/26 5:00 PM,,,,,Action Required,,17/Mar/26 12:00 AM,0,GCS,GDS,GRS,LIFTED,USRM,,,,,,,,,,,"*Originating Market* - GCS Threat Defense & Response (TDR) - Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM)

*What is Happening?*

Wiz vulnerabilities related to EC2 Instances without a Tenable Agent were added to the Vulnerability Workbench. The SLA dates for the vulnerabilities will be calculated as follows:

* +Very Critical+ - Start Date of 3/2/26 with Remediation *Due 3/17/26* (15 days)
* +Critical+ - Start Date of 3/2/26 with Remediation *Due 4/2/26* (30 days)
* +High+ - Start Date of 3/2/26 with Remediation *Due 6/2/26* (90 days)

*Why is it Happening? What is driving this work?*

Wiz EC2 vulnerability data is being surfaced to the Vulnerability Workbench to close a 30% gap in EC2 instances where Tenable is not scanning nor providing visibility into current vulnerabilities. 

*Who is impacted/in-scope for this initiative?*

All EC2 instances without a Tenable agent are in scope. Please refer to the Open Findings Report to view EC2 vulnerabilities requiring remediation [+Enterprise Vulnerability Workbench - Open Findings+|https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/apps/509c4550-1f67-47a1-8a5e-dbd8e392cdf3/reports/d51684c8-0036-48a2-9a08-834e5d5c1d5f/ReportSection?ctid=08a83339-90e7-49bf-9075-957ccd561bf1&experience=power-bi]

*Market(s) Impacted*

* USRM
* GRS
* LIFTED
* GCS
* GDS

*What actions do those impacted need to take?*

# Remediate vulnerabilities per the above SLA dates
# Re-platform to a Liberty Mutual supported AMI or enroll EC2 to 90 day redeploy where applicable
# Work with vendor to address identified vulnerabilities
# IF SLA cannot be met work with BISO team to open an Archer Extension and share finding number with Threat and Vulnerability Management Team via their Service Desk [+TVM Service Desk+|https://forge.lmig.com/issues/servicedesk/customer/portal/958]

*What happens if required actions are not complete by the due date (i.e., business disruption, costs, etc.)?*

If vulnerabilities are not remediated per the stated SLAs, then those will report as breaching SLA in the Vulnerability Dashboard; Threat and Vulnerability Management team uses an Incident process to escalate/manage such vulnerabilities. If a team is not able to remediate a vulnerability, then they may consider opening an Extension via the existing Archer process.

*Do you have an impact list (i.e., excel, report, etc.)?* Yes, [https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/apps/509c4550-1f67-47a1-8a5e-dbd8e392cdf3/reports/d51684c8-0036-48a2-9a08-834e5d5c1d5f/ReportSection?ctid=08a83339-90e7-49bf-9075-957ccd561bf1&experience=power-bi|https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/apps/509c4550-1f67-47a1-8a5e-dbd8e392cdf3/reports/d51684c8-0036-48a2-9a08-834e5d5c1d5f/ReportSection?ctid=08a83339-90e7-49bf-9075-957ccd561bf1&experience=power-bi|smart-link]. 

Use the following filters in the Vulnerability workbench to see the impacted resources:  

* Remediation Required = All 
* Asset Type = Server (AWS EC2)
* Source = Wiz 

*What is Driving the Due Date? Why was this date selected?*

SLA dates are in accordance with defined vulnerability requirements and standards. [+Remediation SLAs - GCS Threat & Vulnerability Management - Confluence+|https://libertymutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GVM/pages/390170046/Remediation+SLAs]
